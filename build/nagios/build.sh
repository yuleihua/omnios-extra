SUMMARY="Extremely powerful network monitoring system"
DESC="Nagios is a host and service monitor designed to inform you of network \
problems before your clients, end-users or managers do. It has been \
designed to run under the Linux operating system, but works fine under \
most *NIX variants as well. The monitoring daemon runs intermittent \
checks on hosts and services you specify using external plugins \
which return status information to Nagios. When problems are \
encountered, the daemon can send notifications out to administrative \
contacts in a variety of different ways (email, instant message, SMS, \
etc.). Current status information, historical logs, and reports can \
all be accessed via a web browser."
